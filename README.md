## Usage
This solution has 3 main pages, accessed via a web browser:
- Data capture - Record downtime events and set reasons for each  
  [http://localhost](http://localhost) on the device (i.e. Raspberry Pi) or http://\<ip\> from other devices on the local network (where \<ip\> is the devices fixed IP address) (e.g. http://192.168.0.1 for IP address 192.168.0.1)

- Admin page - Setup Reasons and Machines  
  [http://localhost:8001/admin](http://localhost:8001/admin) on the device or http://\<ip\>:8001/admin from other devices (username `admin`, password is set during solution setup)
 
- Dashboard - View metrics and plots  
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on the device or http://\<ip\>:3000 from other devices (username: admin, password: admin) [Please change password from default]

## Using sensor data to create downtime events
There is an optional analysis module included in this solution that can listen to sensor MQTT data and mark a machine as stopped or running automatically.  
A threshold is configured and numerical data in JSON-over-MQTT from a sensor is compared to it.  
If this module is not required and running status will instead be done by manual input through the webpage, the default config can be left.
